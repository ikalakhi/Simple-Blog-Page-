                    Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web
                    programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP.

            <h4>What is Web development?</h4>
            <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and
                maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design,
                web programming, and database management.
            </p>
            <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The
                term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of
                sites).
            </p>
            <p>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS
                (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or
                facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number
                of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe
                Experience Manager, among others.
            </p>
            <h4>Coding daily, Coding all the time!</h4>
            <p>"Coding daily, coding all the time!" expresses a strong dedication to coding and programming. It reflects the
                enthusiasm of someone who is deeply committed to their work or hobby in the field of coding and software
                development. Many programmers and developers indeed spend a significant amount of their time coding and honing their
                skills to become proficient or to work on various projects.
            </p>
            <p>While dedication and practice are essential for becoming a skilled coder, it's also important to strike a balance to
                prevent burnout and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's crucial to take breaks, rest, and engage in other activities
                to avoid excessive stress and ensure long-term productivity and well-being.
            </p>
            <blockquote>"Coding daily, coding all the time, is the path to mastering the language of computers and unlocking the door
                to endless possibilities in the digital world." &mdash; ChatGPT
            </blockquote>
            <p>Coding every day can be a valuable and productive practice for those who are passionate about programming and want to
                excel in the field
